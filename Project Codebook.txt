'run_Analysis.r', when run on the extracted Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Dataset, Version 1.0, produces three output tables:

X_data_tidy

This table consists of 68 variables and represents the merging of data from the
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

- 'features.txt'
- 'activity_labels.txt'
- 'train/X_train.txt'
- 'train/y_train.txt'
- 'test/X_test.txt'
- 'test/y_test.txt'

into a single table of tidy data containing the merged data that has then been
reduced to only columns with 'mean' or 'std' variables in addition to the 'activity' and
subject variables. The variables of X_data_tidy are:

[1] "activity"                  "subject"                   "tBodyAcc-mean-X"

summary_table

This tables consist of data summarised from X_data_tidy. The table is grouped by Activity then by Subject
and the average of each of data variables is allocated against that grouping. The variables of this table
are similar to X_data_tidy, except they are appended with '_average' to denote their content.
